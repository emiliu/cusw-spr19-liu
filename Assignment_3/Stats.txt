What case study area did you pick and why?
I picked New Jersey, my home state.

What metrics did you pick and why?
I wanted to see the age distribution across different school districts.

What statistical test did you use and why?
I used an ANOVA test to see if one age group in (<5, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19)
was more or less represented than the others.

What was its result? (again not graded for accuracy)
I got an f-ratio value of .31 and a p-value of .82, so turns out there
isn't.
